      With enough space out the back for a few simple raised beds, we decided to grow our own heirloom organic salad greens, herbs, tomatos and a few other bits and pieces to use in our "Bukit Cafe" kitchen. BCC recommended a 20cm base of their topsoil mix, topped with 10cm of organic compost. Within months we had our first harvest of gorgeous home grown produce. Our clients love checking out the gardens while they're eating in the cafe. Thanks, BCC!
